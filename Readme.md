# Car Simulation using Pymunk and Pygame

This little simulation draws and simulates a bunch of cars, all starting in different directions, and only colliding with the walls.

It's supposed to become a fully fledged "Cars learn to drive track" Deep Learning thing using TF one day, if I ever have time to learn the rest of the stuff needed and for the project in general.
